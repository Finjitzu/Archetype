## Programs and Assets
* The character was created and animated in Blender
* Textures were created in GIMP
* Game was build using Unity3D
* [NGUI Assest Bundle](http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140)
* [Affordable Audio 4 Everyone](http://www.affordableaudio4everyone.com/)

Note: I haven't included the complete source project since some assets are purchased 3rd party add-ons (NGUI is amazing and worth the money). I've basically only included assets created by me. There should be some handy scripts in there for some Unity coders.
